This is a **critical blocker** for running training.\n\n---\n\n## 7. CONFIGURATION FILES AND VERSION DETAILS\n\n### Version Information Found:\n- **ROS 2 Distribution:** \"Kilted\" (mentioned in README line 45) - This is **outdated** (should be Humble/Jazzy as of 2024)\n- **Isaac Sim:** Version 5.0.0 (in `setup_isaac_env.sh` line 6)\n- **Gazebo:** References to \"Gazebo Ionic\" in package.xml descriptions\n- **Python:** Mix of Python 3.x (exact version not specified)\n\n### Configuration Files:\n1. **`config.py`** - RL hyperparameters (analyzed above)\n2. **`setup_isaac_env.sh`** - Isaac Sim path setup (hardcoded: `~/isaac-sim/isaac-sim-standalone-5.0.0-linux-x86_64`)\n3. **`configure_cloud_assets.sh`** - Referenced but minimal script\n\n### Critical Version Mismatches:\n- Docs mention \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (2021 EOL) but requirements.txt includes ROS2 Humble+ packages\n- Isaac Sim 5.0.0 vs latest (could be 5.5+)\n- Gymnasium used (newer) instead of Gym (old)\n\n---\n\n## 8. DEPENDENCIES AND REQUIREMENTS FILES\n\n**`requirements.txt`** (208 lines) contains:\n- **Machine Learning:** `torch==2.6.0.dev`, `stable-baselines3`, `onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2`, `ultralytics==8.3.232`\n- **ROS2 Humble/Jazzy:** Full stack (rclpy, geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs, etc.)\n- **CV/Perception:** `opencv-python==4.12.0.88`, `torchvision==0.20.0.dev`\n- **Robotics:** `ros_gz_bridge==2.1.11`, `ros_gz_sim==2.1.11`\n- **Utilities:** matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy\n\n**Issues:**\n- Development versions of torch/torchvision (`2.6.0.dev`, `.dev20241112`)\n- No version constraints on critical packages (allows breakage)\n- Mix of stable + development versions (fragile for reproduction)\n- CUDA 12.1 assumed but not verified\n\n**Missing from requirements:**\n- `gymnasium` (used in environments but not listed!)\n- `isaacsim` (Isaac Sim API not in pip requirements - requires manual installation)\n\n**No setup.py at root level** - project structure unclear for packaging\n\n---\n\n## 9. DOCUMENTATION FILES\n\n| File | Coverage | Status |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| **README.md** | High-level overview | Outdated (references missing scripts) |\n| **QUICK_START.md** | Step-by-step tutorial | Has incomplete TODO (line 189: \"TODO: Create inference node\") |\n| **PROJECT_EXPLAINED.md** | Deep technical explanation | 600+ lines but references deleted files |\n| **TRAINING_COMMANDS.md** | Command reference | Short, references old files |\n\n**Documentation Quality Issues:**\n- References to non-existent training scripts (`train_simple.py`, `train_parallel.py`)\n- Hardcoded paths in examples (e.g., `~/PersonalPorjects/...`, `~/ros2-ml-env/`)\n- \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (wrong distribution)\n- Missing world files referenced everywhere\n\n---\n\n## 10. IDENTIFIED ISSUES, OUTDATED CODE, AND CLEANUP NEEDS\n\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (Blocks Execution):\n\n1. **Missing World Files**\n   - `/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/` directory missing\n   - Referenced files don't exist: `rl_test_world.sdf`, `rl_training_world.sdf`\n   - **Impact:** Cannot run training\n\n2. **Duplicate Isaac Leatherback Loading** (isaac_leatherback_env.py:49-63)\n   - Attempts to load from hardcoded local path, then again from cloud\n   - Second load will fail/override first\n   - **Impact:** Environment initialization unpredictable\n\n3. **Hardcoded Paths**\n   - `/home/jayoungh/PersonalPorjects/Leatherback-main/...` (not portable)\n   - `~/isaac-sim/isaac-sim-standalone-5.0.0-linux-x86_64` (version-specific)\n   - **Impact:** Code won't work on other machines\n\n4. **Gazebo Environment Expects Wrong Topics**\n   - Code publishes to `/cmd_vel` (differential drive)\n   - But Ackermann models expect `/control/steering` + `/control/throttle`\n   - **Impact:** Vehicle won't respond to commands\n\n5. **Missing Gymnasium in requirements.txt**\n   - Code imports `gymnasium` but not in requirements\n   - **Impact:** Training fails with ImportError\n\n6. **API Inconsistency in Isaac Sim**\n   - Mix of `isaacsim.core.api` and `omni.isaac.core`\n   - Bare except clauses hide import failures\n   - **Impact:** Fragile to API changes\n\n### HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:\n\n7. **Duplicate Configuration Settings** (config.py)\n   - Reward settings repeated in RewardConfig\n   - Multiple BOUNDARY definitions commented/active\n   - **Impact:** Confusion about actual configuration\n\n8. **Subprocess Management in gazebo_env.py**\n   - Spawns ROS processes inline without cleanup guarantee\n   - No timeout handling\n   - Could leave zombie processes\n   - **Impact:** System instability during training\n\n9. **Inconsistent Package Versioning**\n   - All packages at `0.0.0` or `0.1.0`\n   - No semantic versioning\n   - **Impact:** No way to track releases\n\n10. **Placeholder Maintainer Info**\n    - All package.xml files have `your@email.com`\n    - Should be `jayoungh@eafit.edu.co`\n    - **Impact:** Professional issues\n\n### MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:\n\n11. **Outdated ROS2 Distribution References**\n    - Documentation mentions \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (2021, EOL)\n    - Should specify Humble or Jazzy\n    - **Impact:** Version mismatch during setup\n\n12. **Development/Pre-release Dependencies**\n    - `torch==2.6.0.dev20241112+cu121` (development build)\n    - `torchvision==0.20.0.dev20241112+cu121`\n    - `onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2` (old, latest is 1.18+)\n    - **Impact:** Unreproducible builds\n\n13. **Empty Packages**\n    - `data_collection/data_collection/` has only `__init__.py`\n    - Never implemented\n    - **Impact:** Maintenance confusion\n\n14. **Unused Code**\n    - `smart_car.sdf` not referenced anywhere\n    - `_archive/` directory with abandoned attempts\n    - Old Waymo parser utilities\n    - **Impact:** Code bloat\n\n15. **Poor Error Handling**\n    - Bare `except: pass` statements (line 89 isaac_leatherback_env.py)\n    - No logging of errors\n    - **Impact:** Hard to debug failures\n\n### LOW PRIORITY CLEANUP:\n\n16. **Archive Directory**\n    - Contains old Isaac Sim attempts\n    - Vision/raceway goal environments (superseded)\n    - Should be removed or moved to Git history\n\n17. **Debug Files in Root**\n    - `debug_hierarchy.txt` (165KB)\n    - `detailed_log.txt` (77KB)\n    - `hierarchy.txt` (41KB)\n    - Should be in `.gitignore` or removed\n\n18. **Large Binary Artifacts**\n    - `leatherback_ppo_v1.zip` (5.2MB) - trained model in root\n    - Should be in `/models/` with metadata\n\n19. **Inconsistent Testing**\n    - Some packages have ament linting tests\n    - Others have none\n    - No unified test runner\n\n---\n\n## 11. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS\n\n### Critical External Dependencies:\n- **Isaac Sim 5.0.0:** Not in pip, requires separate installation\n- **ROS2 Distribution:** Unclear which one (docs say Kilted, code says Humble/Jazzy)\n- **Gazebo Sim:** Version not specified (assumes Ionic)\n- **CUDA 12.1:** Hardcoded in torch packages\n\n### Compatibility Matrix Issues:\n```\nIsaac Sim 5.0.0 ← May not be compatible with latest ROS2\n     ↓\nGazebo Sim + ROS2 ← Two parallel paths\n     ↓\nLeatherback Robot ← Needs cloud assets configured\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12. ARCHITECTURAL OBSERVATIONS\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Modular ROS2 packages** - Good separation of concerns\n2. **Unified configuration** (config.py) - Single source of truth\n3. **PPO training infrastructure** - Proper callbacks, checkpointing\n4. **Multi-environment support** - Can parallelize training\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Two incompatible simulator paths** - Isaac Sim vs Gazebo\n2. **Missing critical files** - World definitions, models\n3. **Hardcoded paths everywhere** - Not portable\n4. **No containerization** - Environment setup fragile\n5. **Poor separation of concerns** - Training code in root + src/\n6. **No CI/CD** - No automated testing/building\n\n### Duplicate Implementation:\n- Two different environment implementations (`isaac_leatherback_env.py` vs `gazebo_env.py`)\n- Two training scripts (`train_sb3.py` vs `train_ppo.py`)\n- Unclear which is the \"canonical\" approach\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLEANUP\n\n**Phase 1 - Critical (Blocks Usage):**\n1. Create missing world files in `/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/`\n2. Resolve Isaac Sim vs Gazebo duplication - pick one path\n3. Fix hardcoded paths to environment variables\n4. Add `gymnasium` to requirements.txt\n5. Fix topic naming inconsistencies\n\n**Phase 2 - Important (Code Quality):**\n1. Consolidate configuration (remove duplicate settings)\n2. Clean up subprocess management in gazebo_env.py\n3. Replace bare except clauses with proper error handling\n4. Update all package.xml files with correct versions/maintainers\n5. Remove or archive unused models (`smart_car.sdf`, etc.)\n\n**Phase 3 - Polish (Maintenance):**\n1. Remove debug files from root (or .gitignore)\n2. Move large artifacts to proper directories\n3. Consolidate training scripts (single entry point)\n4. Add CI/CD pipeline\n5. Update documentation for current ROS2 distribution\n6. Add automated tests for each package\n\n**File Paths (Absolute):**\n- Main issue files: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/isaac_leatherback_env.py`, `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/rl_training/rl_training/gazebo_env.py`, `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/config.py`\n- Missing: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/` (critical)\n- All ROS2 packages: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/*/package.xml`"},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a05dd6d (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"0ee483d2-fd87-436d-b3c4-8f3c41d72524","timestamp":"2025-12-24T16:40:05.556Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Thoroughly explore the current codebase structure of this autonomous driving project with Isaac Sim.

CONFIGURATION FILES AND VERSION DETAILS\n\n### Version Information Found:\n- **ROS 2 Distribution:** \"Kilted\" (mentioned in README line 45) - This is **outdated** (should be Humble/Jazzy as of 2024)\n- **Isaac Sim:** Version 5.0.0 (in `setup_isaac_env.sh` line 6)\n- **Gazebo:** References to \"Gazebo Ionic\" in package.xml descriptions\n- **Python:** Mix of Python 3.x (exact version not specified)\n\n### Configuration Files:\n1. **`config.py`** - RL hyperparameters (analyzed above)\n2. **`setup_isaac_env.sh`** - Isaac Sim path setup (hardcoded: `~/isaac-sim/isaac-sim-standalone-5.0.0-linux-x86_64`)\n3. **`configure_cloud_assets.sh`** - Referenced but minimal script\n\n### Critical Version Mismatches:\n- Docs mention \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (2021 EOL) but requirements.txt includes ROS2 Humble+ packages\n- Isaac Sim 5.0.0 vs latest (could be 5.5+)\n- Gymnasium used (newer) instead of Gym (old)\n\n---\n\n## 8. DEPENDENCIES AND REQUIREMENTS FILES\n\n**`requirements.txt`** (208 lines) contains:\n- **Machine Learning:** `torch==2.6.0.dev`, `stable-baselines3`, `onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2`, `ultralytics==8.3.232`\n- **ROS2 Humble/Jazzy:** Full stack (rclpy, geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs, etc.)\n- **CV/Perception:** `opencv-python==4.12.0.88`, `torchvision==0.20.0.dev`\n- **Robotics:** `ros_gz_bridge==2.1.11`, `ros_gz_sim==2.1.11`\n- **Utilities:** matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy\n\n**Issues:**\n- Development versions of torch/torchvision (`2.6.0.dev`, `.dev20241112`)\n- No version constraints on critical packages (allows breakage)\n- Mix of stable + development versions (fragile for reproduction)\n- CUDA 12.1 assumed but not verified\n\n**Missing from requirements:**\n- `gymnasium` (used in environments but not listed!)\n- `isaacsim` (Isaac Sim API not in pip requirements - requires manual installation)\n\n**No setup.py at root level** - project structure unclear for packaging\n\n---\n\n## 9. DOCUMENTATION FILES\n\n| File | Coverage | Status |\n|------|----------|--------|\n| **README.md** | High-level overview | Outdated (references missing scripts) |\n| **QUICK_START.md** | Step-by-step tutorial | Has incomplete TODO (line 189: \"TODO: Create inference node\") |\n| **PROJECT_EXPLAINED.md** | Deep technical explanation | 600+ lines but references deleted files |\n| **TRAINING_COMMANDS.md** | Command reference | Short, references old files |\n\n**Documentation Quality Issues:**\n- References to non-existent training scripts (`train_simple.py`, `train_parallel.py`)\n- Hardcoded paths in examples (e.g., `~/PersonalPorjects/...`, `~/ros2-ml-env/`)\n- \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (wrong distribution)\n- Missing world files referenced everywhere\n\n---\n\n## 10. IDENTIFIED ISSUES, OUTDATED CODE, AND CLEANUP NEEDS\n\n### CRITICAL ISSUES (Blocks Execution):\n\n1. **Missing World Files**\n   - `/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/` directory missing\n   - Referenced files don't exist: `rl_test_world.sdf`, `rl_training_world.sdf`\n   - **Impact:** Cannot run training\n\n2. **Duplicate Isaac Leatherback Loading** (isaac_leatherback_env.py:49-63)\n   - Attempts to load from hardcoded local path, then again from cloud\n   - Second load will fail/override first\n   - **Impact:** Environment initialization unpredictable\n\n3. **Hardcoded Paths**\n   - `/home/jayoungh/PersonalPorjects/Leatherback-main/...` (not portable)\n   - `~/isaac-sim/isaac-sim-standalone-5.0.0-linux-x86_64` (version-specific)\n   - **Impact:** Code won't work on other machines\n\n4. **Gazebo Environment Expects Wrong Topics**\n   - Code publishes to `/cmd_vel` (differential drive)\n   - But Ackermann models expect `/control/steering` + `/control/throttle`\n   - **Impact:** Vehicle won't respond to commands\n\n5. **Missing Gymnasium in requirements.txt**\n   - Code imports `gymnasium` but not in requirements\n   - **Impact:** Training fails with ImportError\n\n6. **API Inconsistency in Isaac Sim**\n   - Mix of `isaacsim.core.api` and `omni.isaac.core`\n   - Bare except clauses hide import failures\n   - **Impact:** Fragile to API changes\n\n### HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:\n\n7. **Duplicate Configuration Settings** (config.py)\n   - Reward settings repeated in RewardConfig\n   - Multiple BOUNDARY definitions commented/active\n   - **Impact:** Confusion about actual configuration\n\n8. **Subprocess Management in gazebo_env.py**\n   - Spawns ROS processes inline without cleanup guarantee\n   - No timeout handling\n   - Could leave zombie processes\n   - **Impact:** System instability during training\n\n9. **Inconsistent Package Versioning**\n   - All packages at `0.0.0` or `0.1.0`\n   - No semantic versioning\n   - **Impact:** No way to track releases\n\n10. **Placeholder Maintainer Info**\n    - All package.xml files have `your@email.com`\n    - Should be `jayoungh@eafit.edu.co`\n    - **Impact:** Professional issues\n\n### MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES:\n\n11. **Outdated ROS2 Distribution References**\n    - Documentation mentions \"ROS 2 Kilted\" (2021, EOL)\n    - Should specify Humble or Jazzy\n    - **Impact:** Version mismatch during setup\n\n12. **Development/Pre-release Dependencies**\n    - `torch==2.6.0.dev20241112+cu121` (development build)\n    - `torchvision==0.20.0.dev20241112+cu121`\n    - `onnxruntime-gpu==1.23.2` (old, latest is 1.18+)\n    - **Impact:** Unreproducible builds\n\n13. **Empty Packages**\n    - `data_collection/data_collection/` has only `__init__.py`\n    - Never implemented\n    - **Impact:** Maintenance confusion\n\n14. **Unused Code**\n    - `smart_car.sdf` not referenced anywhere\n    - `_archive/` directory with abandoned attempts\n    - Old Waymo parser utilities\n    - **Impact:** Code bloat\n\n15. **Poor Error Handling**\n    - Bare `except: pass` statements (line 89 isaac_leatherback_env.py)\n    - No logging of errors\n    - **Impact:** Hard to debug failures\n\n### LOW PRIORITY CLEANUP:\n\n16. **Archive Directory**\n    - Contains old Isaac Sim attempts\n    - Vision/raceway goal environments (superseded)\n    - Should be removed or moved to Git history\n\n17. **Debug Files in Root**\n    - `debug_hierarchy.txt` (165KB)\n    - `detailed_log.txt` (77KB)\n    - `hierarchy.txt` (41KB)\n    - Should be in `.gitignore` or removed\n\n18. **Large Binary Artifacts**\n    - `leatherback_ppo_v1.zip` (5.2MB) - trained model in root\n    - Should be in `/models/` with metadata\n\n19. **Inconsistent Testing**\n    - Some packages have ament linting tests\n    - Others have none\n    - No unified test runner\n\n---\n\n## 11. DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS\n\n### Critical External Dependencies:\n- **Isaac Sim 5.0.0:** Not in pip, requires separate installation\n- **ROS2 Distribution:** Unclear which one (docs say Kilted, code says Humble/Jazzy)\n- **Gazebo Sim:** Version not specified (assumes Ionic)\n- **CUDA 12.1:** Hardcoded in torch packages\n\n### Compatibility Matrix Issues:\n```\nIsaac Sim 5.0.0 ← May not be compatible with latest ROS2\n     ↓\nGazebo Sim + ROS2 ← Two parallel paths\n     ↓\nLeatherback Robot ← Needs cloud assets configured\n```\n\n---\n\n## 12. ARCHITECTURAL OBSERVATIONS\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Modular ROS2 packages** - Good separation of concerns\n2. **Unified configuration** (config.py) - Single source of truth\n3. **PPO training infrastructure** - Proper callbacks, checkpointing\n4. **Multi-environment support** - Can parallelize training\n\n### Weaknesses:\n1. **Two incompatible simulator paths** - Isaac Sim vs Gazebo\n2. **Missing critical files** - World definitions, models\n3. **Hardcoded paths everywhere** - Not portable\n4. **No containerization** - Environment setup fragile\n5. **Poor separation of concerns** - Training code in root + src/\n6. **No CI/CD** - No automated testing/building\n\n### Duplicate Implementation:\n- Two different environment implementations (`isaac_leatherback_env.py` vs `gazebo_env.py`)\n- Two training scripts (`train_sb3.py` vs `train_ppo.py`)\n- Unclear which is the \"canonical\" approach\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLEANUP\n\n**Phase 1 - Critical (Blocks Usage):**\n1. Create missing world files in `/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/`\n2. Resolve Isaac Sim vs Gazebo duplication - pick one path\n3. Fix hardcoded paths to environment variables\n4. Add `gymnasium` to requirements.txt\n5. Fix topic naming inconsistencies\n\n**Phase 2 - Important (Code Quality):**\n1. Consolidate configuration (remove duplicate settings)\n2. Clean up subprocess management in gazebo_env.py\n3. Replace bare except clauses with proper error handling\n4. Update all package.xml files with correct versions/maintainers\n5. Remove or archive unused models (`smart_car.sdf`, etc.)\n\n**Phase 3 - Polish (Maintenance):**\n1. Remove debug files from root (or .gitignore)\n2. Move large artifacts to proper directories\n3. Consolidate training scripts (single entry point)\n4. Add CI/CD pipeline\n5. Update documentation for current ROS2 distribution\n6. Add automated tests for each package\n\n**File Paths (Absolute):**\n- Main issue files: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/isaac_leatherback_env.py`, `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/rl_training/rl_training/gazebo_env.py`, `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/config.py`\n- Missing: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/vehicle_gazebo/worlds/` (critical)\n- All ROS2 packages: `/home/jayoungh/Autonomous-driving-ML-ROS2-GAZEBO/src/*/package.xml`"}],"totalDurationMs":307006,"totalTokens":62626,"totalToolUseCount":64,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3268,"cache_read_input_tokens":54382,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3268,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4969,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Line 51: `/home/jayoungh/PersonalPorjects/Leatherback-main/...`\n   **Fix:** Use environment variable or relative paths\n\n5. **Duplicate variable initializations (lines 178-181, 292-294):**\n   ```python\n   # In __init__\n   self.num_waypoints = 10\n   self.current_waypoint_idx = 0\n   \n   # In _spawn_obstacles (duplicated!)\n   self.num_waypoints = 10\n   self.current_waypoint_idx = 0\n   ```\n   **Fix:** Remove duplicates from `_spawn_obstacles`\n\n### 4.2 Refactored Environment Structure\n\n**New file: `isaac_lab/envs/leatherback_env.py`**\n\nKey changes:\n1. Use Isaac Lab's `DirectRLEnv` or `ManagerBasedRLEnv` base class\n2. Separate configuration into `leatherback_env_cfg.py`\n3. Use `omni.isaac.lab` imports (Isaac Lab standard)\n4. Remove all hardcoded paths\n5. Add proper error handling\n6.

It mostly worked, but there's an issue at the end - Isaac Lab is trying to find an `isaacsim` package or a symlink to `_isaac_sim`, but neither exists because:\n\n1. The user has a standalone Isaac Sim installation at `~/isaac-sim/isaac-sim-standalone-5.1.0-linux-x86_64`\n2. Isaac Lab expects either the pip-installed `isaacsim` package OR a symlink to the standalone installation\n\nThe solution is to create a symlink from `~/IsaacLab/_isaac_sim` to the standalone Isaac Sim installation.\n\nAlso, there was an error during the `isaaclab` module installation - it couldn't find `dex-retargeting==0.4.6` because Python 3.13 isn't supported. The user is running Python 3.13 in their miniconda base environment, but Isaac Sim 5.1.0 requires Python 3.11.\n\nThis is a significant issue - Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim 5.1.0 require Python 3.11, not Python 3.13.\n\nLet me help them fix this by:\n1.
